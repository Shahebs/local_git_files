3] Risk Factor: high (inhibitor) 
Title: Using RHSM has been skipped but no custom or RHUI repositories have been delivered. 
Summary: Leapp is run in the mode when the Red Hat Subscription Manager is not used (the --no-rhsm option or the LEAPP_NO_RHSM=1 environment variable has been set) so leapp is not able to obtain YUM/DNF repositories with the content for the target system in the standard way. 
 
The content has to be delivered either by user manually or, in case of public clouds, by a special Leapp package for RHUI environments. 
 
 
 
Remediation: [hint] Create the repository file according to instructions in the referred document on the following path with all repositories that should be used during the upgrade: "/etc/leapp/files/leapp_upgrade_repositories.repo".
