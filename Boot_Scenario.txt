5]  Getting  the `rpm -va`  and Packages details outside chroot Environment,  if the rpm command inside chroot Environment is not working. 

~~~ 

#rpm -Va --root=/mnt/sysimage  &> /tmp/rpmva.out 

# egrep -v " c | d | g " /tmp/rpmva.out | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq | xargs rpm -qf  --root=/mnt/sysimage 2>/dev/null | sort | uniq &> /tmp/pkgs.out 

 
 

# rpm -qa --root=/mnt/sysimage --queryformat "%{NAME} = %{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}.%{ARCH} = %{VENDOR} \n" | sort &> /tmp/forth-rpm.out 
~~~ 

Gather /tmp/rpmva.out /tmp/pkgs.out and /tmp/forth-rpm.out from customers.  

 
 

6] Gather the screenshot of the boot failure. 

~~~ 

i) Interrupt the countdown at GRUB if it can get to GRUB 

ii) Highlight the kernel you are attempting to boot into and press e to modify the kernel parameters 

   iii) Remove all instances of 'rhgb' and 'quiet'  

   iv) Boot with the changes 

      - RHEL 6: Press "b"    

            - RHEL 7/8: "Ctrl + x" key 

    Note : any changes made are only temporary for the current boot cycle. 

  v) If the Plymouth Splash screen appears (the red and white loading bar), remove it with ESC or an arrow key 

vi) Gather screenshots from there and attach to the case.
