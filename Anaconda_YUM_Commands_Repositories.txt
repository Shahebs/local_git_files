What is Repository? 

A software repository is a central place which stores the software packages for the particular application.All the Linux distributions are maintaining their own repositories and they allow users to retrieve and install packages on their machine. 

Each vendor offered a unique package management tool to manage their repositories such as search, install, update, upgrade, remove, etc.Most of the Linux distributions comes as freeware except RHEL and SUSE. To access their repositories you need to buy a subscriptions. 

Why do we need to enable third party repositories? 

In Linux, installing a package from source is not advisable as this might cause so many issues while upgrading the package or system that’s why we are advised to install a package from repo instead of source. 

How do we find out the installed packages came from which repository on RHEL/CentOS Systems? 

This can be done in multiple ways. Here we will be giving you all the possible options and you can choose which one is best for you. 

Method-1: Using Yum Command 

RHEL & CentOS systems are using RPM packages hence we can use the Yum Package Manager to get this information. 

YUM stands for Yellowdog Updater, Modified is an open-source command-line front-end package-management utility for RPM based systems such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS. 

Yum is the primary tool for getting, installing, deleting, querying, and managing RPM packages from distribution repositories, as well as other third-party repositories.

Description : ApacheTop watches a logfile generated by Apache (in standard common or 
            : combined logformat, although it doesn't (yet) make use of any of the extra 
            : fields in combined) and generates human-parsable output in realtime. 
 

The apachetop package is coming from epel repo. 

Method-2: Using Yumdb Command 

Yumdb info provides information similar to yum info but additionally it provides package checksum data, type, user info (who installed the package). Since yum 3.2.26 yum has started storing additional information outside of the rpmdatabase (where user indicates it was installed by the user, and dep means it was brought in as a dependency). 

# yumdb info lighttpd 
 
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror 
lighttpd-1.4.50-1.el7.x86_64 
     checksum_data = a24d18102ed40148cfcc965310a516050ed437d728eeeefb23709486783a4d37 
     checksum_type = sha256 
     command_line = --enablerepo=epel install lighttpd apachetop aria2 atop axel 
     from_repo = epel 
     from_repo_revision = 1540756729 
     from_repo_timestamp = 1540757483 
     installed_by = 0 
     origin_url = https://epel.mirror.constant.com/7/x86_64/Packages/l/lighttpd-1.4.50-1.el7.x86_64.rpm

     var_contentdir = centos 
     var_infra = stock 
     var_uuid = ce328b07-9c0a-4765-b2ad-59d96a257dc8 
 

The lighttpd package is coming from epel repo. 

Method-3: Using RPM Command 

RPM command stands for Red Hat Package Manager is a powerful, command line Package Management utility for Red Hat based system such as (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE & Mageia) distributions. 

The utility allow you to install, upgrade, remove, query & verify the software on your Linux system/server. RPM files comes with .rpm extension. RPM package built with required libraries and dependency which will not conflicts other packages were installed on your system.

The apachetop package is coming from epel repo. 

Method-4: Using Repoquery Command 

repoquery is a program for querying information from YUM repositories similarly to rpm queries. 

# repoquery -i httpd

How to find out the installed packages came from which repository on Fedora System? 

DNF stands for Dandified yum. We can tell DNF, the next generation of yum package manager (Fork of Yum) using hawkey/libsolv library for back-end. Aleš Kozumplík started working on DNF since Fedora 18 and its implemented/launched in Fedora 22 finally. 

Dnf command is used to install, update, search & remove packages on Fedora 22 and later system. It automatically resolve dependencies and make it smooth package installation without any trouble.

How to find out the installed packages came from which repository on ArchLinux System? 

Pacman command stands for package manager utility. pacman is a simple command-line utility to install, build, remove and manage Arch Linux packages. Pacman uses libalpm (Arch Linux Package Management (ALPM) library) as a back-end to perform all the actions. 

# pacman -Ss chromium

How to find out the installed packages came from which repository on Debian Based Systems? 

It can be done in two ways on Debian based systems such as Ubuntu, LinuxMint, etc., 

Method-1: Using apt-cache Command 

The apt-cache command can display much of the information stored in APT’s internal database. This information is a sort of cache since it is gathered from the different sources listed in the sources.list file. This happens during the apt update operation. 

$ apt-cache policy python3 
python3: 
  Installed: 3.6.3-0ubuntu2 
  Candidate: 3.6.3-0ubuntu3 
  Version table: 
     3.6.3-0ubuntu3 500 
        500 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu artful-updates/main amd64 Packages 
*** 3.6.3-0ubuntu2 500 
        500 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu artful/main amd64 Packages 
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status 
 

The python3 package is coming from Ubuntu updates repo. 

Method-2: Using apt Command 

APT command stands for Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) which is replacement for apt-get, like how DNF came to picture instead of YUM. It’s feature rich command-line tools with included all the futures in one command (APT) such as apt-cache, apt-search, dpkg, apt-cdrom, apt-config, apt-key, etc..,. and several other unique features. For example we can easily install .dpkg packages through APT but we can’t do through Apt-Get similar more features are included into APT command. APT-GET replaced by APT Due to lock of futures missing in apt-get which was not solved.
