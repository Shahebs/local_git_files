Error : '404- Forbidden - Read of user data is forbidden'  
 
I see you are using Account number 1193110 in the API call, Please note we need to use Account ID instead of account number. You can get account ID using curl or in the swagger. 
 
Using  Curl:  
 
 
 
# curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -X 'GET' 'https://api.access.redhat.com/account/v1/accounts?firstResultIndex=0&maxResults=100' | jq 
 
 
Using swagger: 
 
 
Go to https://access.redhat.com/management/api/account#/users/getAccountDetailsUsingGET  >> Click on 'try it out' >> Click on 'Execute'  and in the response body you will see Account Details (Account ID & Account name ).  
 
Use that same Account ID for all API endpoints related to account management. It should work as expected since you do have Org admin rights in the account. Here your account ID is 5857761. 
 
 
For Ex:  

  

#curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -X 'GET' 'https://api.access.redhat.com/account/v1/accounts/5857761/users?firstResultIndex=0&maxResults=100&status=enabled' | jq 
 
 
Q: Is it alternative API for the same? Or this is user management not reflated to RH support portal?  API: https://developers.redhat.com/api-catalog/api/accounts-management-service 
 
>> Yes, Those API endpoints are   () different one , for user management we only have RHSM API api.access.redhat.com .

Troubleshooting steps ...   
========================================================== 
 
 
Step 1 : Obtain offline_token from https://access.redhat.com/management/api 
 
 
 
Step 2 :  Set the offline token  
           
# offline_token='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' 
 
 
 
*Verify it's set: 
 
           
# echo $offline_token 
 
 
 
Step 3 : Get the access token 
 
    
 
      # curl https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token -d grant_type=refresh_token -d client_id=rhsm-api -d refresh_token=$offline_token 
 
 
 
 
Step 4 : Grab the access token with the function we created before 
          
        
 
# token=$(curl https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token -d grant_type=refresh_token -d client_id=rhsm-api -d refresh_token=$offline_token | jq --raw-output .access_token) 
 
        
 
Verify the access_token is set 
 
       # echo $token 
 
 
 
Step 5 : Perform an API call:  
 
 
         # curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"  "https://api.access.redhat.com/management/v1/systems?limit=100"
