This procedure is QUICK GUIDE for a reference purpose for upgrading the x86_64 arch system (registered to RHSM), for other architectures  please refer to the mentioned Documentation. 

 
 

1] Register the system and enable the base and extras repository. 

~~~ 

# subscription-manager register 

# subscription-manager attach --auto 

# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-rpms 

# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms 

~~~ 

 
 

2]  Unset version lock/release from the system, if any. 

 ~~~ 

# subscription-manager release --show   >>>>>>>>> Shows the version lock release 

# subscription-manager release --unset 

# yum versionlock clear 
~~~ 

 
 

3] Ensure you have the system locale set to en_US.UTF-8: 

~~~  

$ cat /etc/locale.conf 

~~~~ 

 
 

4]  Update the system to the latest version and reboot the system for new packages and kernel to take effect. 

~~~ 

# yum update  

# yum install leapp leapp-repository leapp-deps 

# reboot 
~~~ 

 
 

5]  Download the data files attached to the Knowledgebase article Data required by the Leapp utility for an in-place upgrade from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8 and place them in the /etc/leapp/files/ directory. This is necessary for a successful upgrade. Note that currently you need data files from the leapp-data14.tar.gz archive or later. This is necessary for a successful upgrade in the following scenarios:  

 
 
 
 

6]  Capture the preupgrade data. 

~~~ 

# leapp preupgrade  
~~~ 

Review the preupgrade report and check for `INHIBITORS` and eliminate them one by one with the remediation steps mentioned in `/var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt`.   

Backup/clone the system before going for the upgrade. 

 
 

7]  If everything is fine then go ahead with the upgrade 

~~~ 

# leapp upgrade --debug    (for registered system) 

OR  

# leapp upgrade --enablerepo repository_id1 --enablerepo repository_id2  --no-rhsm  (for unregistered /RHUI/custom repo systems) 

 
 

# reboot  
~~~ 

NOTE:- During reboot/upgrade please make sure the `Physical/Virtual`  console is open for checking the upgrade related activities .  

 
 

8]  Post upgrade task.  

Remove remaining RHEL 7 packages, Locate remaining RHEL 7 packages: 

~~~ 

# rpm -aq | grep -v -e '[.+]el8' -e '^gpg-pubkey-' -e '^libmodulemd1-' -e '^katello-ca-consumer' 
~~~ 

- Determine the old kernel version:  
~~~ 
# cd /lib/modules && ls -d *.el7* 

~~~ 

- Remove weak modules from the old kernel 

~~~ 

# [ -x /usr/sbin/weak-modules ] && /usr/sbin/weak-modules --remove-kernel <version> 
~~~ 

 
 
 
 

- Replace version with the kernel version determined in the previous step, for example 

~~~ 

#  [ -x /usr/sbin/weak-modules ] && /usr/sbin/weak-modules --remove-kernel 3.10.0-1160.25.1.el7.x86_64 

~~~ 

 
 

- Remove the old kernel from the bootloader entry:  

~~~ 

# /bin/kernel-install remove <version> /lib/modules/<version>/vmlinuz 

Example:-  

/bin/kernel-install remove 3.10.0-1160.25.1.el7.x86_64 /lib/modules/3.10.0-1160.25.1.el7.x86_64/vmlinuz 

~~~ 

 
 
 

Log Files :-  

 
 

Log Files to be Requested from Customer for verifying the preupgrade results. 

~~~ 

/var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt 

/var/log/leapp/answerfile 

 
 

If used --verbose or --debug  used with the `leapp preupgrade` command. 

/var/log/leapp/leapp-upgrade.log
