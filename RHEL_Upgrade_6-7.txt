This procedure is QUICK GUIDE for a reference purpose for upgrading the x86_64 arch system for other supported architectures  please refer to the Documentation Section. 

 
 

1] Register the system and enable the base, optional and extras repository. 

~~~ 

# subscription-manager register 

# subscription-manager attach --auto 

# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-6-server-extras-rpms --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms 

~~~ 

 

2]  Unset version lock/release of the system, if any. 

~~~ 

# subscription-manager release --show 

# subscription-manager release --unset 

# yum versionlock clear 
~~~ 

 

3]  4]  Update the system to the latest version and reboot the system for new packages and kernel to take effect. 

~~~ 

# yum update  

# yum install preupgrade-assistant preupgrade-assistant-el6toel7 redhat-upgrade-tool 

# reboot 
~~~ 
 

4]  Capture the pre-upgrade results. 

~~~ 

# preupg 
~~~ 

When the preupg command is run without further options, it produces the result.html and preupg_results-*.tar.gz files in the /root/preupgrade/ directory.  

 

Review and check `result.html` and resolve problems found by the Preupgrade Assistant during the assessment by following the Remediation text in the `result.html` file. Please check `Pre-upgrade assessment result codes` from the documentation section. 
 

5]  Upgrading your system from RHEL 6 to RHEL 7.  There are 3 ways to upgrade the system. 

 

NOTE :-  Disable active repositories to prevent problems with combining packages from different major releases of RHEL before upgrade.  Backup/clone the system before going for the upgrade. 

 

--cleanup post: Automatically removes Red Hat-signed packages that do not have a RHEL 7 replacement. Recommended. If you do not use the --cleanup-post option, 

   

-Iso Image  

~~~ 

# redhat-upgrade-tool --iso  <iso_path/of/Latest_RHEL7_iso>  --cleanup-post 

~~~  

 

Mounted installation media 

~~~ 

# lsblk        (TO check the devices) 

# redhat-upgrade-tool --device device_path --cleanup-post 

~~~ 

If you do not specify the device path, the Red Hat Upgrade Tool scans all mounted removable devices.  

 
 

Network Installation by hosting the installation repositories over the network. 

~~~ 

# redhat-upgrade-tool --network 7.9 --instrepo <ftp-or-http-url-of-repos> --cleanup-post 
~~~ 

 
 

- Reboot the system to boot with the `redhat-upgrade-tool` initramfs to proceed with the upgrade. 

 
 
 

NOTE:- During reboot please make sure the `Physical/Virtual`  console is open for checking the upgrade related activities  

 
 
 

6] Post Upgrade Task/precautions. 

 
 

- Remove the residue RHEL 6 packages from upgrade.  

~~~ 

# rpm -qa | grep .el6 &> /tmp/el6.txt 

# rpm -e $(cat /tmp/el6.txt) --nodeps 

~~~ 

 
 

- Migrate from Grub to GRUB2

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/upgrading_from_rhel_6_to_rhel_7/index 

 
 

2]  Know Issue :-  

In-place upgrade from a RHEL 6 system to RHEL 7 is impossible with FIPS mode enabled  

In-place upgrade on IBM Z fails and causes a data loss if the LDL format is used  

The Preupgrade Assistant reports notchecked if certain packages are missing on the system  

redhat-upgrade-tool fails to reconfigure the network interfaces, preventing the upgrade to happen  

redhat-upgrade-tool fails to reconfigure the static routes on the network interfaces, preventing the upgrade to happen  

Why does Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 to 7 in-place upgrade fail if /usr is on separate partition?
